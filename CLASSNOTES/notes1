ansible

- a configuration management tool
- helps ops guys to manage the infra
- rather than configuring manually we can use ansible
- its like puppet but its different and has some thing uniq
- ansible is quiet simple when compared to puppet
- it uses YAML language
- ansibel machine is only linux only ( also it needs python)
- and it cannot be any other server
- for each server we need to do password less authentication
- ansible needs python 
- every configuration will be passed as python package and will be removed after ansible installation

configuration:

/etc/ansible/hosts - file u need to mention the group name and ip/hostname below the group name

for example
[webserver]
10.10.10.10

now you can check the connectivity from ansible - server

ansible -m ping testserver

not ansible server will ping all the mentioned hosts mentioned in the testserver group
 -m here is module
